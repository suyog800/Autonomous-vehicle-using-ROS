# Autonomous vehicle using ROS
 In this project, we have designed and developed an autonomous robot that is powered by Robot Operating System (ROS). The capabilities of the robot include autonomous lane detection and sign detection using Open CV and Neural networks. 

In recent years, self-driving car research is becoming the main direction of automotive companies. BMW, Bosch, Google, Baidu, Toyota, GE, Tesla, Ford, Uber, and Volvo are investing in autonomous driving research.

The rapid development of this field has promoted a large demand for autonomous-cars engineers. Among the skills required, knowing how to program with ROS is becoming an important one.

Therefore,Self-driving cars are inevitable.

Self-Drive Features:
- Lane Detection using OpenCV
- Road side-Sign Detection Using Tensorflow (CNN)

We have successfully implemented lane detection using OpenCV as a tool.

Our Team has successfully trained the model for roadside sign detection using transfer learning in Tensor flow.

Conclusion and Future Scope

The autonomous car is an exciting subject whose demand for experienced engineers is increasing year after year. ROS is one of the best options to quickly jump into the subject. So learning ROS for self-driving vehicles is becoming an important skill for engineers. We have presented here a full path to design and develop a self-driving car using ROS and Open CV  All stipulated objectives were successfully completed in their entirety.

Keeping up with the technological advances at present we plan to deploy lane detection with deep learning in real-life scenarios and integrate it with traffic lights detection and ADAS systems.
